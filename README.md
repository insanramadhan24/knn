K Means Clustering

1. Dataset
Dataset is generated using random normal distribution with mu = 5

2. Method
method using KN means calculation, to calculate the distance and find a nearest point to determine the cluster.

3. Output
output of this function are
  a. knn -> iteration history for the algorithm
  b. clusteres -> Set of cluster point at the end of iteration
  c. C -> centroid coordinate at the end of iteration
